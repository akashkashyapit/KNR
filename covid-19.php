                                        <p>The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) primarily spreads by droplets when an

                                            others, coronavirus can also be transmitted via contact if, for example, an
                                            infected person coughs in his hands and then touches another person. There
                                            are no known cases of infection via items, animals or foodstuff. COVID-19
                                            can also spread by air, but spreading by droplets is much more common than
                                            airborne infections.</p>

                                        <li>Clients must also be provided with the opportunity to wash their hands or
                                            use a hand sanitizer and be instructed to do so. There must be enough soap
                                            and towels, preferably disposable towels, or an automated towel dispenser
                                            with a retractable towel at all places for washing hands. If you cannot wash
                                            your hands, make sure you have hand sanitizer close to you.</li>
                                        <li>Frequent hand washing may cause skin symptoms such as dryness. We recommend
                                            using fragrance and preservative free skin creams to prevent any skin
                                            symptoms. Hand sanitizers that contain glycerol (glycerines) offer a more
                                            skin-friendly alternative to washing your hands. It reduces the drying of
                                            skin caused by alcohol (ethanol or propanol).</li>

                                <li>Remove your face mask by holding both ear loops with a wide grip and lifting off the mask.</li>
                                <li>Keep hold of your mask from the ear loops while your ID is inspected.</li>
                                <li>Don’t put down your mask.</li>
                                <li>When the person inspecting your ID has given you permission, put your mask back on carefully, trying not to touch your face with your hands.</li>
                                <li>Fit the upper part of the mask to the shape of your nose and readjust the position of your mask.</li>
                                <li>Clean your hands with hand sanitiser.</li>
                                <li>Put away your ID.</li>
